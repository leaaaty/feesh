            <p>To my favourite Feesh, Finana Ryugu.
                <br/><br/>
                Happy Birthday, Finana!!!üéâ Thank you for bringing happiness to me every day for the past three years. Thanks to you and all Lazulight members, I came to know about Nijisanji and you guys are the reason I started following Nijisanji, I'm always grateful for that. We've had many moments over the past 3 years, fun moments and even difficult moments, and you should know that we will always be there to accompany you through the difficult moments.
                <br/><br/>
                There are so many memorable moments, from all the chatting about "Eggs", the "What's a Solar?" moment, to the legendary stream (and one of my all time fav. streams of all Niji EN members) The "Drunk Phasmophobia" stream with Elira, you always bring me happiness. The thing that impresses me the most from the beginning of your debut until now is that you always appreciate Clippers so much, you always retweet and like the clips we make. That's a very memorable thing for me.
                <br/><br/>
                As you celebrate this Birthday, know that you are cherished not just as a Vtuber but as a bright light in the lives of many. May the currents of success carry you forward, and may your journey be filled with Happiness.
                <br/><br/>
                We will always be here enjoying your stream, playing games, and creating unforgettable memories for years to come with you. We'll be here, cheering you on every step of the way, as proud members of Ryuguards.
                <br/><br/>
                Best wishes~

                I am so happy to be able to celebrate your day with you and all of the other Ryuguards! I‚Äôve always loved you and the things you create, and the time you put into projects just for us will always baffle me. You are such an inspirational person in the way you not only push yourself to achieve better, but your peers and your fans as well. You‚Äôre so funny and I always find myself laughing when I watch your streams, which really cheer me up after a long day at work or if I‚Äôm just having a rough day. I haven‚Äôt been here long, but I really feel at home thanks to the community you created alongside the Ryuguards. You should be proud of all that you have achieved and what you will continue to achieve, and be even prouder of the person that you are! Thank you for everything you have done and I, along with my fellow Ryuguards, will be here to support you every step of the way!!

                Hi Finana!
                <br/><br/>This is probably my first time writing a letter to you, so please bear with me. I may have discovered you a bit later than everyone else, but I hope I can contribute just as much to this community. FYI, I'm a big fan of your music, from 'Tsunami' to 'Distant,' as well as your song covers. I introduced 'Tsunami' to my siblings, and my lil sis got obsessed with that song up until now. It's truly a banger of the century. I really appreciate you doing tons of covers for us despite being busy. I hope one day we can repay you as a thank you.
                <br/><br/>Watching your streams brings me joy, especially when you truly enjoy the game you're playing. You have genuine and funny reactions each time, which makes it even better. Personally, I really enjoyed watching you play 'Devour' with LazuLight + Rosemi, where you hard carried them; it was truly one of my favorite streams. I also love watching your Valorant streams. You make me proud with how much improvement you've made each day. Not to forget, you never fail to amaze me with your VA skills. Recently, I was given a new project for work so I apologize for missing most of your livestreams, but know that I still watch your VODs whenever I'm free. Sometimes I put you on in the background while working.
                <br/><br/>Anyways... Happy Birthday Feesh! I'm proud to say that you're my first kamioshi ever. I hope you know how talented you are as both a singer and a content creator. I'll always be here supporting you and looking forward to many more memories together with you and the Ryuguards. Trust me when I say you're amazing because you're more than just amazing. May all your wishes come true, and I wish nothing but happiness for you. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
                <br/><br/>Love you, Finana (platonically).

A lot of thing happened and I know you have been through a lot too. You still stand strong. I always look up to you of how strong you are. You may not notice but Finana, you are still the same one when I met you. Your honesty, your kindness and your genuine care are shown. It's surprising me how you still catch up. How you keep taking care of your community. I felt love and that's all from your effort. Thank you for not giving up on us or on yourself. Thank you for be such a kind soul in this cruel world. Thank you for bringing us so many smile for many years. I was happy when I knew you and Im still happy now. Im not actually a Vtuber fan or in fact I dont really interested in the appearance of any kind of anime girls. 
                <br/><br/>
                Finana Ryugu, I dont love you because you have the best design nor the best voice etc, I love you because of who you really are-Your soul. Im glad that I know someone with this beautiful soul still exists. We know you love us and that's why we love you fina. It's reflecting. Action = Reaction. Thank you for your hardworking. Thank you for being inspiration to many and others. Thank you for being motivation for us to keep going. No matter what people say you are the real one, you will prove them wrong, our baby fish girl

                Hello Feesh and Happy Birthday!! I am the hopcon Valo discord kitten husband! My online handles are all Krysalis except YouTube which is just my name, Louis Leo. I‚Äôve been following Lazulight very casually since you guys debuted but I‚Äôve only recently started being active in chat and the Ryuguard community! 
                <br/><br/>Leading up to the meet and greet during Virtual Rhapsody, I was already starting to consume more of your content with my wife which has now become an activity we enjoy doing together, stream or VOD! Speaking to you at the M&G was a huge turning point for me. Actually having a one on one (sort of if we just ignore staff san) conversation with you really made me emotional on top of the nerves I was feeling at the time. Maybe it was just the event adrenaline but your bratty voice sounded a lot sweeter to my ears than any of your streams I‚Äôve watched and this memory is stored in its own special place in my heart üíö
                <br/><br/>Ever since then I have made the utmost effort to catch you live!! Which is a challenge since you usually stream at 4pm which is 4am where I am. But just as I am about to lose the battle against the sandman, your voice greeting chat perks me up and I am awoken from the sleepy spells! 
                <br/><br/>During the days where you rest (please get plenty of rest Fina!!) and I don‚Äôt have live Feesh to power me through the dreadful morning, VOD Feesh gaming comes clutch.
                <br/><br/>Like you, I go to the gym regularly! And after hearing you take the 30min walk to and from the gym, it has inspired me to do the same since I live around 30mins from my closest gym! 
                <br/><br/>Okay I'm gonna be degen for a bit please forgive me but hearing you whisper in UNSEISO has awoken something in me that I never knew existed.
                <br/><br/>I hope you like the pictures I took of you (merch) !! Especially the pape one where I took you to the beach!!
                <br/><br/>Also!! I don‚Äôt speak for all the Ryuguards but I know some of them will agree with me when I say we enjoy watching you play what you enjoy!  As you‚Äôve heard from me during the M&G, my wife and I went back to play Valorant because of you and we regularly play now! I understand the content creator brain that wants to play what is popular at that point of time but really I am happy that you put yourself in your little chair and speak to chat as you do what you‚Äôre doing!! Keep being the cute little Feeshy that you are and know that the Ryuguards love and appreciate you for who you are and the effort that you put into making your streams a fun and safe space to be in üíö
                <br/><br/>Love you Finaüíöüíöüíö!!!

                Dear Finana,
                <br/><br/>Happy Birthday!! I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre already 4 years old this year! Our favourite granny! It really feels like just yesterday when I saw a thumbnail with a cute mermaid princess which led me to watching your stream for the first time years ago. Thank you so much for everything you do for us, I‚Äôve always felt that your streams with the other Ryuguards in a way feels like home thanks to the comfort you bring. Every stream is fun, and entertaining thanks to you, and you‚Äôve achieved so much this year with your covers and original song! I‚Äôm already looking forward to what else you‚Äôre working on! Your streams always brightens my day, and it gives me the motivation to try my best everyday! Please keep shining, and you‚Äôll always be my kamioshi! Don‚Äôt forget to take care of yourself first and foremost, and have a great Birthday Finana, our precious Feesh!

                Hello Feesh, for this special occasion that is your birthday, I'm recording in french to send you love straight from France !
                <br/>And there is a lot I want to tell you bit I'm gonna go to the point. So I hope you're gonna spend an amazing day, with your amazing community, the Ryuguards, which gave me the opportunity to record this.
                Hell, I may not be the freshest fish in this pond, but I'm so proud to be a part of the Ryuguards and to support you Feesh. And for your birthday, I'm gonna teach you how we truly say I love you in french, cause nobody says Je t'aime anymore, we say, repeat after me, "Je te kiff b√©b√©". So if you wanna rizz someone effectively in french, tell them "Je te kiff b√©b√©."
                <br/>Happy Birthday Finana, from France, Dataconsumed.

                Happy Birthday Finana!
                <br/>You turned 4, but you are still a LazuGranny! It's been so fun to spend these last 3 years with you, and seeing hoe much you've grown as a stream and a person. You have so much love for all your fans and all of your coworkers, and I hope we can show you even a fraction of that love today in return! thank you for always brightening up our days, and cheers to another year!

                Happy Birthday, Finana!!
                <br/>Have a grateful day!!
                <br/>I‚Äôm Japanese and have studied English to watch your stream.
                <br/>I didn‚Äôt like English and hadn‚Äôt been to foreign countries. However I went to Singapore due to join virtual rhapsody. This is first my foreign trip!!! and had wonderful time!!
                <br/>Now, I watch your stream everyday after my work and you make me feel good.
                <br/>(I love your horror stream. Please, Finana!!)
                <br/><br/>Thanks to you, I am able to expand my possibilities.
                <br/><br/>There have been many difficult times, but I will always support you!!

                Dear Finana! It is that time again in the year when we can celebrate the arrival of a sweet mermaid into our lives. It fills me with nostalgia to look back and remember how I accidentally found a stream of yours. From that very moment I understood what it was like to have a kami oshi, I have supported you from the moment I met you and I will continue to do so for much longer. I want to thank you for being my safe place in my most difficult moments and for having accompanied me throughout almost my entire university life. A few months ago I finished my studies and the first thing that came to my mind were all those afternoons or nights where you were my only company and you gave me the push I needed to give my best. I will always be grateful and proud to be a ryuguard. Love u Feesh.

                Happy Birthday Finana!!! It's honestly been a blessing seeing learn and grow as a content creator. You've done so much for us over these years and I'm glad to be one of the many to witness all of it. You put in a crazy amount of work that honestly deserves even more recognition. You brought this community together with your bright, bubbly, and cute energy and I can't wait to see what else you have to bring us. It felt like it was just yesterday when you were afraid to sing and now you're dropping banger after banger and I honestly couldn't be happier. Seeing you foster your talent was an amazing experience. I know I'm not the loudest or the most noticeable Ryuguard but I'm here for you no matter what ever you plan on doing. And I know we say this all the time but take breaks when you need them, we'll be here to support you no matter what.
